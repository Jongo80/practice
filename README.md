prerequisites:
    Docker, docker compose (preferably docker compose v2)

To launch the app execute:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

the front end is accessible on: http://localhost:3000

Good to set the browser's language to English because ReactStrap has localization to some features of the site but of course the whole frontend is not localized
